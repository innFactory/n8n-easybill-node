# n8n-nodes-easybill

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use the Easybill API in your n8n workflows.

Easybill is a service for managing invoices and billing. This node is a work in progress – it's not completely finished yet.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation. (No need for detailed instructions here – this is just a rough draft.)

## Operations

_List the operations supported by your node here. (This section is still under construction, so details may be missing.)_

## Credentials

_If users need to authenticate with Easybill, include details here. For now, just set up your API key and secret as needed – I haven’t added detailed instructions yet._

## Compatibility

_Tested with n8n versions X and above. There might be issues with older versions. More details to come later._

## Usage

This section is pretty bare-bones for now.  
- Add the node in your workflow.
- Configure your Easybill credentials.
- Use it to create or update invoices.  

For now, consider this a quick and dirty solution until I polish everything up.
